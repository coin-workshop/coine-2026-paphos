CALL FOR PAPERS

************************************************************************************
International Workshop on Coordination, Organizations, Institutions, 
Norms and Ethics for Governance of Multi-Agent Systems (COINE), 
co-located with AAMAS 2026
************************************************************************************

COINE 2026 is co-located with the International Conference on Autonomous Agents and
Multiagent Systems (AAMAS), Paphos, Cyprus, 25 May-29 May 2026 (https://cyprusconferences.org/aamas2026/)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The growing pervasiveness of “open systems” raises a range of challenges and 
opportunities for developing technologies in the area of autonomous agents and 
multi-agent systems (MAS). In open MAS, artificial and human autonomous agents, 
their modes of interaction and the pursued goal of the system may change over time. 
The view of coordination and control has to be expanded to consider not only an 
agent-centric perspective but societal and organization-centric views as well.
Moreover, in the case of open multi-agent systems, the autonomy of the agents can 
work against the effectiveness of the system and of the society. 
There is therefore a need for tools and techniques for articulating interactions in 
order to make MAS more effective in attaining collective goals, aligning agent 
behaviors with shared human values, and more trustworthy, predictable and 
understandable for humans.

Coordination, organizations, institutions, norms and ethics are five key 
governance elements for the regulation of open multi-agent systems. COINE is an 
evolution of the COIN (Coordination, Organizations, Institutions and Norms in 
Agent Systems) workshop series that ran at various conferences including 
AAMAS (18 times), IJCAI (twice), AAAI in 2008 and ECAI in 2006 and 2016 
(see Workshop Series Website), and produced 17 volumes of post-proceedings in 
Springer’s Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence. In 2020, ethics was added 
to the name and acronym (now COINE), and also the notion of governance of MAS 
was added to the full workshop title as this is the common objective uniting 
the various threads of research (coordination, organizations, etc.) undertaken. 
The workshop in the new format has been held six times (2020--2025). 

Continuing this tradition, the goal of the COINE workshop is to bring together 
researchers in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems working on the scientific 
and technological aspects of social coordination, organizational theory, normative 
MAS, artificial or electronic institutions, and agents aware of norms, policies, 
and ethics.

We invite submissions that address any of the following aspects:

	- Mathematical, logical, computational, philosophical, legal, and 
	pragmatic issues related to the issues above
    - Modeling, animation and simulation techniques for open MAS
    - Tools, prototypes and actual working systems
    - Topics investigating the relationship between COINE and the rapidly 
    evolving AI landscape (e.g., including LLMs and Generative AI)
    - Topics exploring the value-aligned problems within MAS in the COINE domain
    - Experimental investigation of the effectiveness of COINE technologies
    - Challenging or innovative ideas relevant to the field

The workshop complements the main AAMAS program by allowing a more 
relaxed and in-depth discussion of MAS from a social perspective and has 
proven to be an event that encourages debate, and fosters collaboration 
among researchers in these topics.

Instructions for Authors
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For preparation of papers please follow the instructions for authors 
available at the Springer LNCS Web page. 

We solicit three types of papers in the LNCS format (https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines):
• Full research papers (16 pages)
• Short research papers (10 pages) – These 'early-innovation' papers are work-in-progress papers and these will be reviewed with an emphasis on novelty/originality of the idea.
• Blue sky ideas (up to 16 pages) – These papers have the same scope of the blue sky ideas track of AAMAS 2026 (see https://cyprusconferences.org/aamas2026/call-for-blue-sky-ideas/), focussing on the COINE topics

The page lengths mentioned above include figures and references. All papers must be written in English and submitted in PDF format. Information about the paper type should be included at the end of the title of the paper – (Full), (Short) or (Blue Sky ideas).

For submission of papers, please use the OpenReview.net site at: _(to be announced soon)_

Submitted papers will be reviewed on a "single-blind" basis by at least two independent PC members.
The evaluation criteria of contributions will be based on 
originality, quality, clarity, and its relevance to the workshop.

Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking that, should 
the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will attend the 
workshop to present the work.

Proceedings
-----------
As with previous COIN(E) workshops, COINE will publish post-proceedings 
in Springer’s LNCS series. Authors will be invited to submit revised and 
extended versions of their paper for consideration in these 
post-proceedings.

Revised papers must take into account the discussion held during the workshop; 
hence, only papers that are presented during the workshop will be considered 
for inclusion in the post-proceedings volume.
