- Workshop: May 25th or 26th, 2026

### Overview

The growing pervasiveness of “open systems” raises a range of challenges and opportunities for developing technologies in the area of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (MAS). In open MAS, artificial and human autonomous agents, their modes of interaction and the pursued goal of the system may change over time. The view of coordination and control has to be expanded to consider not only an agent-centric perspective but societal and organization-centric views as well. Moreover, in the case of open multi-agent systems, the autonomy of the agents can work against the effectiveness of the system and of the society. There is therefore a need for tools and techniques for articulating interactions in order to make MAS more effective in attaining collective goals, aligning agent behaviors with shared human values, and more trustworthy, predictable and understandable for humans.

Coordination, organizations, institutions, norms and ethics are five key governance elements for the regulation of open multi-agent systems. COINE is an evolution of the COIN (Coordination, Organizations, Institutions and Norms in Agent Systems) workshop series that ran at various conferences including AAMAS (18 times), IJCAI (twice), AAAI in 2008 and ECAI in 2006 and 2016 (see [Workshop Series Website](http://www2.pcs.usp.br/~coin)), and produced 17 volumes of post-proceedings in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence. The 18th volume of COINE post-proceedings is in progress. In 2020, ethics was added to the name and acronym (now COINE), and also the notion of governance of MAS was added to the full workshop title as this is the common objective uniting the various threads of research (coordination, organizations, etc.) undertaken. The workshop in the new format has been held six times (2020--2025).

Continuing this tradition, the goal of the COINE workshop is to bring together researchers in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems working on the scientific and technological aspects of social coordination, organizational theory, normative MAS, artificial or electronic institutions, and agents aware of norms, policies, and ethics.

We invite submissions that address any of the following aspects:
- Mathematical, logical, computational, philosophical, legal, and pragmatic issues related to the issues above
- Modeling, animation and simulation techniques for open MAS
- Tools, prototypes and actual working systems
- Topics investigating the relationship between COINE and the rapidly evolving AI landscape (e.g., including LLMs and Generative AI)
- Topics exploring the value-aligned problems within MAS in the COINE domain
- Experimental investigation of the effectiveness of COINE technologies
- Challenging or innovative ideas relevant to the field

The workshop complements the main AAMAS program by allowing a more relaxed and in-depth discussion of MAS from a social perspective and has proven to be an event that encourages debate, and fosters collaboration among researchers in these topics.

### Instructions for Authors

For preparation of papers please follow the instructions for authors available at the Springer LNCS Web page.

We solicit three types of papers in the [LNCS format](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines):
- Full research papers (16 pages, excluding references)
- Short research papers (10 pages, excluding references) – These 'early-innovation' papers are work-in-progress papers and these will be reviewed with an emphasis on novelty/originality of the idea.
- Blue sky ideas (up to 16 pages, excluding references) – These papers have the same scope of the blue sky ideas track of AAMAS 2026 (see [https://cyprusconferences.org/aamas2026/call-for-blue-sky-ideas/](https://cyprusconferences.org/aamas2026/call-for-blue-sky-ideas/)), focusing on the COINE topics


All papers must be written in English and submitted in PDF format. __*Information about the paper type should be included at the end of the title of the paper – (Full), (Short) or (Blue Sky ideas).*__

For submission of papers, please use the OpenReview.net site at: _(to be announced soon)_

Submitted papers will be reviewed on a "single-blind" basis by at least two PC members.

Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will attend the workshop to present the work. Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their work in person by default. Exceptions may be granted by the organizing committee on a case-by-case basis, and authors who receive such exceptions may present their work online, provided they register for the workshop. Presentations will be delivered in the Eastern Time Zone.

### Proceedings

As with previous COIN(E) workshops, COINE intends to publish post-proceedings in Springer's LNCS series (pending confirmation). Authors will be invited to submit revised and extended versions of their paper for consideration in these post-proceedings.

Revised papers must take into account the discussion held during the workshop; hence, only papers that are presented during the workshop will be considered for inclusion in the post-proceedings volume.
