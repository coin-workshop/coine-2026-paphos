Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The growing pervasiveness of “open systems” raises a range of challenges and
opportunities for developing technologies in the area of autonomous agents and
multi-agent systems (MAS). In open MAS, artificial and human autonomous agents,
their modes of interaction and the pursued goal of the system may change over time.
The view of coordination and control has to be expanded to consider not only an
agent-centric perspective but societal and organization-centric views as well.
Moreover, in the case of open multi-agent systems, the autonomy of the agents can
work against the effectiveness of the system and of the society.
There is therefore a need for tools and techniques for articulating interactions in
order to make MAS more effective in attaining collective goals, aligning agent
behaviors with shared human values, and more trustworthy, predictable and
understandable for humans.

Coordination, organizations, institutions, norms and ethics are five key
governance elements for the regulation of open multi-agent systems. COINE is an
evolution of the COIN (Coordination, Organizations, Institutions and Norms in
Agent Systems) workshop series that ran at various conferences including
AAMAS (18 times), IJCAI (twice), AAAI in 2008 and ECAI in 2006 and 2016
(see Workshop Series Website), and produced 17 volumes of post-proceedings in
Springer's Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence. In 2020, ethics was added
to the name and acronym (now COINE), and also the notion of governance of MAS
was added to the full workshop title as this is the common objective uniting
the various threads of research (coordination, organizations, etc.) undertaken.
The workshop in the new format has been held six times (2020--2025).

Continuing this tradition, the goal of the COINE workshop is to bring together
researchers in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems working on the scientific
and technological aspects of social coordination, organizational theory, normative
MAS, artificial or electronic institutions, and agents aware of norms, policies,
and ethics.

We invite submissions that address any of the following aspects:
    - Mathematical, logical, computational, philosophical, legal, and
        pragmatic issues related to the issues above
    - Modeling, animation and simulation techniques for open MAS
    - Tools, prototypes and actual working systems
    - Topics investigating the relationship between COINE and the rapidly
    evolving AI landscape (e.g., including LLMs and Generative AI)
    - Topics exploring the value-aligned problems within MAS in the COINE domain
    - Experimental investigation of the effectiveness of COINE technologies
    - Challenging or innovative ideas relevant to the field

The workshop complements the main AAMAS program by allowing a more
relaxed and in-depth discussion of MAS from a social perspective and has
proven to be an event that encourages debate, and fosters collaboration
among researchers in these topics.

Instructions for Authors
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The instructions for authors is available at the Springer LNCS web page
(https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).

We admit three types of papers formatted according to the Springer LNCS
style:
  - Full research papers (16 pages)
  - Short research papers (10 pages): 'Early-innovation' papers are
    work-in-progress papers and these will be reviewed with an emphasis
    on novelty/originality of the idea.
  - Blue sky ideas (up to 16 pages): These papers have the same scope of
    the blue sky ideas track of AAMAS 2026
   (see https://cyprusconferences.org/aamas2026/call-for-blue-sky-ideas/)

The page lengths include figures and references. All papers must be written
in English and submitted in PDF format. Information about the paper type
should be included at the end of the title of the paper - (Full), (Short)
or (Blue Sky ideas).

Papers must be electronically submitted before the submission deadline
through the workshop conference system available at:
https://openreview.net/group?id=ifaamas.org/AAMAS/2026/Workshop/COINE

Submitted papers will be reviewed on a "single-blind" basis by at least two
independent PC members. The evaluation criteria of contributions will be based
on originality, quality, clarity, and its relevance to the workshop.

Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking that, should
the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will attend the
workshop to present the work.

Proceedings
-----------
As with previous COIN(E) workshops, COINE will publish post-proceedings
in Springer's LNCS series. Authors will be invited to submit revised and
extended versions of their paper for consideration in these
post-proceedings.

Revised papers must take into account the discussion held during the workshop;
hence, only papers that are presented during the workshop will be considered
for inclusion in the post-proceedings volume.
